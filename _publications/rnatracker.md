Gene expression is modulated jointly by transcriptional regulation and messenger RNA stability, yet the latter is often overlooked in studies on genetic variants. Here, leveraging metabolic labeling data (Bru/BruChase-seq) and a new computational pipeline, RNAtracker, we categorize genes as allele-specific RNA stability (asRS) or allele-specific RNA transcription events.
