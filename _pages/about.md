Under construction.

Hi, I'm a Bioinformatics PhD candidate at UCLA in the laboratory of Xinshu (Grace) Xiao. My research involves working with transcriptomics data to delineate the functionalities of RNA variants (encompassing both genetic variants and transcriptional modifications). 

Currently, I am seeking post-doctoral positions :)
