Under construction.

Hi, I'm a Bioinformatics PhD candidate at UCLA in the laboratory of Xinshu (Grace) Xiao. My research involves working with transcriptomics data to delineate the functionalities of RNA variants (encompassing both genetic variants and transcriptional modifications). 

Currently, I am seeking post-doctoral positions :) I am interested in leveraging novel sequencing technologies (e.g. long-read sequencing) and data analysis approaches (e.g. personal genome assembly, pangenome references) to better understand how the diversity of human genomes yields transcriptomic consequences. I look forward to challenging myself to learn new techniques and frameworks of thinking in this next stage of my career. 

Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance running, reading, and attempting various arts & crafts.
